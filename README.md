# Simple Furniture Store Project

This is a very basic furniture store project that I originally wrote in PHP about three years ago. It was my first project, created as a simple way to experiment and learn the basics of web development. Due to various reasons, I didnâ€™t upload it until now.

Please note that this project is quite simple and lacks many modern features or optimizations. It serves as a starting point for those interested in seeing the early steps of my coding journey.

Feel free to explore, and keep in mind that this project reflects my initial understanding of PHP and web development. Thank you for visiting!
